# Lab Report 3
## Part 1: Bug
In Lab 3, we'll analyze a bug by emphasizing array manipulation. Our objective is to illuminate the debugging journey, starting with a problematic input, a smooth-sailing input, proceeding to symptoms, the flawed original code, the rectified version, and concluding with an elucidation of the solution.
## A Failure-Inducing Input
This updated JUnit test presents a scenario where the program falters due to flawed array reversal logic, particularly when handling an even count of elements.
```
@Test
public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = { 4,3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3, 4 }, input1);
}
```
## An Input That Doesnâ€™t Induce a Failure
This revised test illustrates a situation where the program operates as expected, effectively managing an array comprising an odd number of elements.
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```
## The Symptom
![Pic](https://github.com/jjvsqz/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-08%20204551.png)
The symptom of the bug is visually depicted in the JUnit test output, prominently signaling a failure within the testReverseInPlace2 method. The anticipated result diverges from the outcome generated by the program under examination.

## The Bug
Before
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
}
```
After
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
    int temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
  }
}
```
## Brief Description
The initial implementation aimed to reverse the array in situ but exhibited incorrect behavior by overwriting elements prior to swapping them. I fixed the code by addressing the bug, ensuring proper element swapping from both ends towards the center, thereby guaranteeing accurate reversal for arrays of any size.

## Part 2 - Researching Commands
In this task, we'll delve into the ```less``` command, crucial for viewing text files in Unix or Linux systems. It offers an interactive approach to navigate text files, presenting portions of text to facilitate reading through extensive files. Below, we'll highlight four intriguing options of ```less```, showcasing its versatility and practicality.

## Chop Long Lines (```-S```)
Ex.1 demonstrates how the command ```less -S ./technical/configurations.cfg``` displays configurations without line wrapping, preserving the layout.
Ex.2 showcases how ```less -S ./technical/data.csv``` maintains column alignment in CSV files, presenting lines without wrapping.
Purpose: It maintains the original layout of wide content by preventing long lines from wrapping to the next line.
(Source: ```man less```)

## Ignore Case in Searches (```-i```)
Ex.1 The command ```less -i ./technical/documentation.md``` allows for finding terms within the Markdown file, disregarding case sensitivity.
Ex.2 Using the command ```less -i ./technical/README``` enhances keyword searching in README files by ignoring differences in case.
Purpose: Enables searches within the viewed file to be case-insensitive, thereby enhancing search flexibility.
(Source: ```man less```)

## Line Numbers (```-N```)
Ex.1 The command ```less -N ./technical/report.txt``` outputs the report.txt file with line numbers, simplifying specific line references.
Ex.2 Utilizing ```less -N ./technical/logs/system.log``` assists in troubleshooting by enabling straightforward referencing of particular log entries.
Purpose: To display line numbers alongside the text for convenient reference.
(Source: ```man less```)

## Suppress Highlighting (```-G```)
Ex.1 Illustrates how the command "less -G ./technical/specifications.txt" improves readability by disabling search term highlighting.
Ex.2 Demonstrates how "less -G ./technical/notes.txt" focuses on the text content by preventing distraction from highlighting.
Purpose: Disables the highlighting of search matches, which can be advantageous in terminals where highlighting obscures text.
(Source: ```man less```)
