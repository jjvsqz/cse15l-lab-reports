# Lab Report 1: Exploring Basic Filesystem Commands
## Introduction
In this lab report, we will go over the fundamentals of exploring and modifying the filesystem using the command line. The emphasis is on three key commands: ‘cd’ to change directories, ‘ls’ to list directory contents, and ‘cat’ to display file contents. Using examples from a workspace produced during this lab, we’ll show each command with and without arguments, providing insights into its behavior and output.
## The cd Command
1. cd with no argument
```
{
juanvasquez@juans-MBP-3 ~ % cd
juanvasquez@juans-MBP-3 ~ %
}
```
