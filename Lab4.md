# # Lab Report 4
## Mastering SSH, Vim, and Java Development Workflow
Throughout this lab, I utilized SSH for remote server access, edited files with Vim, and performed Java code compilation and testing. Detailed below is each step taken with the specific keys pressed to achieve the desired outcomes.
## Step 4: SSH into ieng6
Use SSH to connect to your ieng6 server. This is where you’ll be performing your lab tasks. The jwhiteman part is your username on the ieng6 server.

**Command and Key Presses:**

```
ssh jjv001@ieng6.ucsd.edu
Pressed: s s h Space j j v 0 0 1 @ i e n g 6 . u c s d . e d u <Enter>
```

## Step 5: Clone the GitHub Repository
After successfully logging into the ieng6 server, you’ll clone the repository. This clones your fork of the lab7 repository to the ieng6 server. You’re using the SSH protocol for cloning, which is secure and doesn’t require you to enter your GitHub password thanks to the SSH key you’ve added to your GitHub account.

This command securely connected me to the ieng6-202 server where I could begin my work.

## Step 6: Compile Java Tests and Run Java Tests
Once the repository is cloned, you need to change into the new directory that was created.

## Step 7: Compile Java Tests and Run Java Tests
Compilation of the Java files was necessary to ensure everything was in order before running tests.

## Step 8: Edit Code with Vim and Run Fixed Java File Again
Using Vim, I opened the file that required changes.

## Step 9: Commit and Push Changes
Lastly, I committed the changes and pushed them to the GitHub repository.

## Conclusion
This process not only fixed the bug but also enhanced my familiarity with essential development tools like SSH, Vim, and Git. Through these exercises, I’ve refined my ability to navigate and manipulate files on a remote server, leveraged Vim for quick edits, and solidified my understanding of Git operations.
