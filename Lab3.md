# Lab Report 3
## Part 1: Bug
In Lab 3, we'll analyze a bug by emphasizing array manipulation. Our objective is to illuminate the debugging journey, starting with a problematic input, a smooth-sailing input, proceeding to symptoms, the flawed original code, the rectified version, and concluding with an elucidation of the solution.
## A Failure-Inducing Input
This updated JUnit test presents a scenario where the program falters due to flawed array reversal logic, particularly when handling an even count of elements.
```
@Test
public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = { 4,3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3, 4 }, input1);
}
```
## An Input That Doesnâ€™t Induce a Failure
This revised test illustrates a situation where the program operates as expected, effectively managing an array comprising an odd number of elements.
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```
## The Symptom
![Pic](https://github.com/jjvsqz/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-08%20204551.png)
The symptom of the bug is visually depicted in the JUnit test output, prominently signaling a failure within the testReverseInPlace2 method. The anticipated result diverges from the outcome generated by the program under examination.

## Interaction 1: The Greeting
Upon launching my ChatServer on port 4000, the initial user, jpolitz, greeted:
Upon accessing the URL ```"/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz"```, the system triggered the execution of the ```handleRequest(URI url)``` method within the ```Handler``` class. This method was invoked with the argument of a URI url, specifically new URI```("/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz")```. Subsequently, within this method, I managed the processing of the provided URI, resulting in an update to the chatMessages field. Initially void, the chatMessages string now encapsulates the message ```"jpolitz: Hello\n"```.

## Interaction 2: Question
Shortly thereafter, yash joined the conversation, contributing with:
Upon accessing the URL ```"/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz"```, the system activated my handleRequest(URI url) method within the ```Handler``` class. I handled the method with a URI url parameter, instantiated as new URI```("/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz")```. This processing resulted in an update to the ```chatMessages``` string, which was initially empty but now contains the message "jpolitz: Hello\n".

## Part 2: Generating SSH Keys and Remote Access
I began by initiating a terminal session on my system and executing the ssh-keygen command to produce a fresh set of SSH keys. Throughout the procedure, I was prompted to designate the file location for these keys. Opting for convenience, I elected to store them in the default directory (```~/.ssh/id_rsa``` for the private key and ```~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``` for the public key). In the interest of simplicity, I chose to forgo setting a passphrase, although it remains an option for heightened security. The command completed successfully, generating my identification and public key, along with displaying the key's fingerprint and a randomart image for visual verification.
```
PS C:\User\juanj> ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/juanj/.ssh/id_rsa): 
/Users/juanj/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/juanj/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /Users/juanj/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:0mP7NzXpV+AVzatXYcAO+pIRINCp9gdmcK8RfihDWE juanj@BOOK-CJCG9LS1GL
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|o=B+*o .=+.      |
| o +o=o..o       |
|  o .o+oo        |
|   ...=o         |
|   . .ooS        |
|    o+.o.=..     |
|    =o. ..o.     |
|   o.=   E o.    |
|   o=..   o..    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```
## Locating
Following that, I sought to verify the presence and location of my freshly generated SSH keys. Utilizing the ```ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa``` command, I accessed details regarding my private key, affirming its existence within my ```.ssh``` directory. Additionally, I executed ```ls -l ~/.ssh/``` to enumerate all files in my ```.ssh``` directory, identifying the ```id_rsa``` (private key), ```id_rsa.pub``` (public key), and the ```known_hosts``` file.

```
PS C:\User\juanj> ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa
-rw-------  1 juanj  staff  2635 Apr 24 17:00 /Users/juanj/.ssh/id_rsa
PS C:\User\juanj> ls -l ~/.ssh/
total 40
-rw-r--r--  1 juanj  staff    63 Apr 16 15:40 config
-rw-------  1 juanj  staff  2635 Apr 24 17:00 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1 juanj  staff   596 Apr 24 17:00 id_rsa.pub
-rw-------  1 juanj  staff   272 Apr  9 15:26 known_hosts
-rw-r--r--  1 juanj  staff    96 Apr  9 15:26 known_hosts.old
PS C:\User\juanj>
```

## Copying to Remote Server
With my public key, I employed the ```scp``` command to securely transfer it to the authorized_keys file on the remote server (ieng6 in this instance). Following password authentication, the public key was effectively conveyed to the ```~/.ssh/authorized_keys``` file on the remote server.

```
PS C:\User\juanj> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub jjv001@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/Users/juanj/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
(jjv001@ieng6.ucsd.edu) Password: 

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'jjv001@ieng6.ucsd.edu'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

## SSH into Remote Server Without a Password
In the final step, I verified SSH access to the ieng6 server using my freshly configured SSH keys. Executing ssh ```'jjv001@ieng6.ucsd.edu'```, I successfully logged in without encountering a password prompt, owing to SSH key authentication. Upon access, I was welcomed with the server's message and provided with system status updates.

```
